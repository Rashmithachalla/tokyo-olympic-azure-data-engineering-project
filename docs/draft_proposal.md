# Water Quality Predection
 Safe drinking water access is a fundamental human right, a necessity for good health, and a part of sensible health protection policies. At the national, regional, and municipal levels, this is crucial as a matter of health and development. Investments in water supply and sanitation have been shown to provide a net economic advantage in some areas because they reduce the negative impacts on health and the expenses associated with providing medical treatment.
## Data Source 
https://www.kaggle.com/sharomeethan/water-potability-classifier/

The dataset contains of 9 attributes/features which are; 
### pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfates, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity,

All these attributes are continous

The variable to be predicted is Potability (Discrete) - that defines the consumption state of that particular sample of water.

0 -> not suitable for consumption.

1 -> suitable for consumption

## Goal 
Determine whether a sample of water is potable at >75% precision

## Meathodlogies
I intend to compare each model's accuracy using machine learning techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost etc.

## Deployment
 After deploying the model can predict the portability parameter of water depending on the physical parameters
